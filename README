======================================================================
 Where to Get More Information
======================================================================

See the ``INSTALL'' file for information on running hourglass.

Currently, this is it :)  Check the Wiki, Forums and Trackers on our
home page http://hourglass.sf.net/ if you still need help after reading
the information below (or if you have any kind of request or question).


======================================================================
 Setting Up Your Build Environment
======================================================================

Hourglass has the following dependencies:

o       Java 1.4.0 or newer
o       JUnit (http://junit.org)
o       Log4j (http://jakarta.apache.org/log4j)
o       JCommon (http://www.jfree.org/jcommon/)
o       JDOM (http://jdom.org)

Before you can compile Hourglass, you will need to set up your build
environment.  This involves letting the ant build script know how to
find third-party dependencies.  

Once the dependencies are properly installed, you need to define a
``local.properties'' file in the BASEDIR/conf directory, where BASEDIR
is the base directory of the project (the one that contains this
README and the build.xml file).

The easiest way to get started is simply to copy
BASEDIR/conf/samples/local.properties to BASEDIR/conf/local.properties
and modify the properties beginning with ``jar'' to point the the
respective jar files of the dependencies described above.

Hourglass uses Log4j for all logging output.  By default, Hourglass
produces no logging output (by using a log4j.properties in the runtime
classpath).  If you wish to see the log messages, you will need to set
the ``url.log4j.properties'' property in the local.properties file.
This should be a URL pointing to a log4j.properties or log4j.xml
configuration file, for example, 

# url.log4j.properties=file:///home/mike/src/hourglass/conf/log4j.xml

A sample file can be found in BASEDIR/conf/samples/log4j.xml.  This
configuration file logs all output to a file called ``hourglass.log''
in the current directory.


======================================================================
 Building 
======================================================================

Hourglass is build using Apache Ant (http://ant.apache.org).  Here is
a high-level description of the Ant tasks you will use to build, test,
and run Hourglass.

# ant compile (default)
        Compiles Hourglass

# ant run
        Runs the newly built Hourglass out of the build directory

# ant run.unit-tests
        Runs the unit tests for Hourglass.  The unit tests are written
        using the JUnit framework (http://junit.org).  You will need
        to make sure Ant supports the optinal ``junit'' task, and that
        junit.jar is in the classpath.

# ant clean
        Cleans the project.

# ant dist
        Builds a distribution in the dist directory.  dist/hourglass
        is the top-level distribution directory.  

# ant dist-clean
        Completely cleans the project.

======================================================================
 Running the Distribution
======================================================================

To run the distribution, copy the top-level directory to the path of
your choice and run

# java -jar /path/of/your/choice/hourglass/lib/hourglass.jar
