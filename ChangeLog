version 0.7.0  (22/12/2008)

CHANGE: added myself Eric L. to the developers.
CHANGE: the default behavior is now to keep edits made on time spans (only ESC cancels changes done).
FIX: more strings are now translatable but there is much more to be done.
FIX: timezone set manually is now properly saved.
NEW: hourglass now exits gracefully in case of shutdown, though it doesn't
seem to work properly under Vista (due to a Java or Vista bug).
NEW: it is now possible to enter an integer for a full hour time (e.g. 9 for 9:00).
DEVELCHANGE: added shutdownhook to SummaryFrame class.
DEVELCHANGE: Add javac source and target to local.properties sample for explicit Java versioning (one version below the current one).
DEVELCHANGE: refactorized doClose partially into doShutdown.
DEVELCHANGE: replace Jug/Doomdark UUID functions through java.util.UUID (because Jug is not maintained anymore).
DEVELNEW: swingui.Utilities.getMnemonicAsInt public function
