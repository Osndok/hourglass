version 0.7.2  (04/01/2009)

CHANGE: the Hourglass directory can now be modified using the property
        hg.HOURGLASS_DIR, even using other Java properties.
	See Wiki for details.
DEVELCHANGE: framework/Utilities and swingui/Utilities are now descendants
             of the new BaseUtilities class, but the last word is probably
	     not spoken (I'm not too happy about the result).
DEVELCHANGE: removed Constants.java and all references and replaced through
             calls to immutable Preferences.
DEVELFIX: makes build fit for Gentoo/portage.
          Closes: https://sourceforge.net/tracker2/?func=detail&atid=540904&aid=2481672&group_id=74405
DEVELNEW: a new getPath function for preferences, where variables of the type
          ${var} are replaced by their values.
FIX: The application is quite completely localized, all strings can now be
     translated.
     Closes: http://sourceforge.net/tracker/index.php?func=detail&aid=1197350&group_id=74405&atid=540902
NEW: English Irish as translation on top of the default English one
     (especially to cope for different date/times format).
NEW: preferences can now be modified from the command line using the -D option
     of Java. The details will be documented in the Wiki.
NEW: the 12/24 setting is per default the one defined in the language files.

version 0.7.1  (01/01/2009)

FIX: alleviate (unconfirmed) risk of loss of data through backup versioning.
     Closes: https://sourceforge.net/tracker2/?func=detail&aid=1252111&group_id=74405&atid=540902
FIX: Edit project dialog has now correct title.
     Closes: https://sourceforge.net/tracker/index.php?func=detail&aid=1603326&group_id=74405&atid=540902
FIX: projects without name are now shown as (no name) in the GUI.
     Closes: https://sourceforge.net/tracker2/?func=detail&aid=1603493&group_id=74405&atid=540902
NEW: new preference to select number of backup versions to keep.
     Closes: https://sourceforge.net/tracker2/?func=detail&aid=2475130&group_id=74405&atid=540905

DEVELCHANGE: move from cvs to svn usage.
DEVELCHANGE: moved from JDom0 to JDom1, no special effect expected.
DEVELCHANGE: remove Xerces from the distribution, it makes Hourglass much
             slimmer.
DEVELCHANGE: remove publish target on FTP basis (use ReleaseForge instead).
DEVELCHANGE: merge ErrorKeys with the Strings and remove error_keys.txt.
DEVELCHANGE: resources.properties is used instead of strings.txt for
             generating the Strings class.
DEVELCHANGE: split strings for translation and strings for preferences.
             Strings for preferences are now in HourglassPreferences.properties.
DEVELCHANGE: renamed string PERSIST_ALL_CHANGES to SAVE_ALL_CHANGES.
DEVELFIX: fixed typo in name of InteralMinutes prefs function (now Interval).
DEVELNEW: for each mutable preference, there is a listen<Preference> function.
DEVELNEW: the ant task GenerateStringsTask is now able to generate a class
          out of a properties-alike file.

version 0.7.0  (22/12/2008)

CHANGE: added myself Eric L. to the developers.
CHANGE: the default behavior is now to keep edits made on time spans (only ESC cancels changes done).
FIX: more strings are now translatable but there is much more to be done.
FIX: timezone set manually is now properly saved.
NEW: hourglass now exits gracefully in case of shutdown, though it doesn't
seem to work properly under Vista (due to a Java or Vista bug).
NEW: it is now possible to enter an integer for a full hour time (e.g. 9 for 9:00).
DEVELCHANGE: added shutdownhook to SummaryFrame class.
DEVELCHANGE: Add javac source and target to local.properties sample for explicit Java versioning (one version below the current one).
DEVELCHANGE: refactorized doClose partially into doShutdown.
DEVELCHANGE: replace Jug/Doomdark UUID functions through java.util.UUID (because Jug is not maintained anymore).
DEVELNEW: swingui.Utilities.getMnemonicAsInt public function
