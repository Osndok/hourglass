======================================================================
 Hourglass Installation 
======================================================================

If you've downloaded a source distribution, see the README for
information about how to build Hourglass from source.  This document
assumes you have either built or downloaded a binary distribution of
Hourglass.  

Make sure Hourglass is not running when you update its JAR file!

In the instructions below, DISTDIR is the directory which contains the
Hourglass distribution directory.  If you've downloaded a binary
distribution, DISTDIR is the directory into which you unpacked
distribution.

To install:
----------------------------------------------------------------------
# cp -R DISTDIR/hourglass /path/of/your/choice


To run:
----------------------------------------------------------------------
# java -jar /path/of/your/choice/hourglass/lib/hourglass.jar

You may want to create shell script or batch file to run Hourglass.

Data Storage:
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Project data is stored at $HOME/.hourglass/data.xml by default.
However, there are two ways to change this:

1.  -Dhg.home=<hg_home>  -  This will change the directory
2.  -Dhg.archive.name=<archive_name>  -  Uses <archive_name>.xml
      instead of data.xml

 Where to Get More Information

Currently, this is it :)  Email mike@acm.jhu.edu if you need help
after reading the information above.
